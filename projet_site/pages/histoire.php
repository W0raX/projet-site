                        <p>Five years after the execution of Order 66 and the beginning of the Great Jedi Purge, former Jedi Padawan Cal Kestis is in hiding from the newly risen Galactic Empire. On the planet Bracca, where he works as a scrapper salvaging ships from the Clone Wars, Cal uses the Force to save his friend Prauf from falling to his death. The incident is recorded by an Imperial Probe Droid who relays the information to the Empire. The Empire sends two Inquisitors known as the Second Sister and the Ninth Sister to pursue Cal. After they kill Prauf, Cal makes his escape, briefly engaging the Second Sister before being rescued by a former Jedi Knight named Cere Junda and her partner pilot Greez Dritus in their ship, the Stinger Mantis.</p>

                        <p>Cere takes Cal to the planet Bogano, hoping that Cal may be able to access an ancient vault. On the way to the vault, Cal befriends a small droid named BD-1, who shows him a message from a former Jedi Master named Eno Cordova. The message reveals that the vault was built by an ancient civilization called the Zeffo and that a Jedi Holocron containing a list of Force-sensitive children has been hidden inside by Cordova. Cere believes the list could help rebuild the Jedi Order, but the only way to access the vault is to follow Cordova's path. Cal heads to the Zeffo homeworld and explores an ancient temple. There, he finds a clue pointing to Cordova's friend, the Wookiee chieftain Tarfful, on the planet Kashyyyk.</p>

                        <p>On Kashyyyk, Cal hijacks an Imperial AT-AT and heads towards the forests, on the way encountering notorious insurgent Saw Gerrera. Cal teams up with the Rebels to defeat the Imperial forces and free their Wookiee slave laborers. Unable to find Tarfful, Cal returns to Zeffo to find more clues regarding the Holocron vault. There, he is ambushed by the Second Sister, who reveals herself to be Cere's former Padawan, Trilla Suduri. She was captured by the Empire after Cere revealed her whereabouts under torture. Before he departs, Trilla warns Cal of Cere's inevitable betrayal.</p>

                        <p>Cal learns that he needs to find a Zeffo artifact called an Astrium to unlock the vault, but is then captured by a Haxion Brood bounty hunter and forced to fight in a gladiatorial arena owned by Sorc Tormo, the Haxion boss. Cal is rescued by Cere and Greez, and receives a communication that Tarfful is willing to meet. Back on Kashyyyk, Tarfful instructs Cal to seek answers at the top of the Origin Tree. On the way up, he is attacked by the Ninth Sister, whose ship is taken down by a large winged creature. Cal finds the creature wounded from the attack and heals it, granting him access to the top of the Origin tree via a flight on its back. He finds a recording of Cordova telling him that an Astrium can be found in a Zeffo tomb on Dathomir. Cal is attacked once again by the Ninth Sister and defeats her.</p>

                        <p>On Dathomir, Cal's progress is impeded by Nightsister Merrin, who blames the Jedi for the massacre of her people during the Clone Wars, and attempts to keep him away by creating an army of revenants. Cal experiences a flashback of his former master, Jaro Tapal, sacrificing himself to protect him during Order 66, and is then attacked by Jaro's spirit, leading to his lightsaber's kyber crystal being destroyed. Cal meets former Jedi Taron Malicos, who crash-landed on Dathomir during the Purge and has been seeking to learn the magick of the Nightsisters. Malicos offers to teach Cal how to handle this dark power, but he refuses and flees after Merrin attacks them both. Aboard the Mantis, Cere admits that when she learned Trilla became an Inquisitor, she briefly fell to the dark side, which is why she chose to cut herself off from the Force. After traveling to Ilum to rebuild his lightsaber, Cal returns to Dathomir, where he retrieves the Astrium and overcomes his guilt for his part in Jaro's death. Malicos again tries to tempt Cal to the dark side, but Cal fights him and is able to defeat him with the help of Merrin, who then agrees to join the Mantis crew.</p>

                        <p>The crew returns to Bogano, where Cal uses the Astrium to unlock the vault and reveal the Holocron, but he is once again attacked by Trilla, who steals it and escapes after Cal defeats her. Back on the Mantis, Cere reassumes her status as a Jedi and grants Cal the rank of Jedi Knight. Together they assault the Inquisitor headquarters, a station based in the waters of the planet Nur. Cal reaches the Interrogation Chamber where he defeats Trilla and recovers the Holocron. Cere attempts to make amends with Trilla, but Darth Vader appears and kills Trilla for her failure. Unable to defeat Vader, Cal and Cere barely escape from his grasp with the help of BD-1 and Merrin. Back on the Mantis, Cal, having realized that gathering the children would make it easier for the Empire to target them, destroys the Holocron, believing it to be better for those children to discover their own destinies, without interference. Their mission complete, Cal then asks his crew where they should head next.</p>
